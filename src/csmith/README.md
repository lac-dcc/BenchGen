This document explains how to execute the `compileProgs.py` and `getSize.py` scripts, which are designed to work with C programs generated by **CSmith**, a test-case generator for compilers. These scripts perform the following tasks:

1. **`compileProgs.py`**: Compiles C programs generated by CSmith and saves the executables in a specific directory.
2. **`getSize.py`**: Calculates the sizes of the generated executables and creates a CSV report.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **CSmith**: Installed and properly configured. Ensure that the CSmith include directory is accessible.
- **Clang**: C/C++ compiler installed on your system.
- **`size` command**: A tool for calculating executable sizes.
- **Permissions**: Proper permissions to create files and directories in the execution location.

## 1. Script: `compileProgs.py`

### Description
This script compiles C programs generated by CSmith and saves the executables in the `compiled_progs` directory.

### Usage
1. Ensure that you have already generated C programs using CSmith and that they are located in a specific directory.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 compileProgs.py <path_to_programs>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_programs>` with the path to the directory containing the `.c` files generated by CSmith.

### Example
```bash
python3 compileProgs.py ./programs
```

After execution, the executables will be saved in the `compiled_progs` directory.

## 2. Script: `getSize.py`

### Description
This script calculates the sizes of the generated executables and creates a `sizes.csv` file containing the file names and their sizes in bytes.

### Usage
1. Ensure that the executables have been generated using the `compileProgs.py` script.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 getSize.py <path_to_executables>
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_executables>` with the path to the directory containing the executables.

### Example
```bash
python3 getSize.py ./compiled_progs
```

The `sizes.csv` file will be created in the same directory as the script and will contain the following columns:

- **File**: Name of the executable file.
- **Size**: Size of the executable in bytes.

---

## Workflow

1. **Generate programs with CSmith**:
   ```bash
   csmith > programs/test1.c
   csmith > programs/test2.c
   ```
   Repeat the command to generate multiple programs.

2. **Compile the generated programs**:
   ```bash
   python3 compileProgs.py ./programs
   ```

3. **Calculate the sizes of the executables**:
   ```bash
   python3 getSize.py ./compiled_progs
   ```

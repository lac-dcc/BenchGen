# Grammar Enumeration Scripts Documentation

This document provides an overview of the scripts available in the `src/scripts/grammarEnumeration` folder, along with instructions for compilation, execution, and usage.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **Grammar Enumerator**

The Grammar Enumerator is the main program responsible for generating programs based on a defined grammar.

#### **Compilation**

To compile the program, navigate to the `src/scripts/grammarEnumeration` directory and run the following command:

bash

Copy code

```bash
$ make
```

#### **Execution**

Execute the program with the following command:


```bash
$ ./grammarEnumerator <depth>
```

- `<depth>`: Specifies the depth of the grammar enumeration. Note that the number of generated programs grows exponentially with the depth value. For example, setting `depth=9` generates approximately 11,000 programs.

#### **Output**

The generated programs are saved in the following file:

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/results/programs.txt`

---

### 2. **Program Analyzer**

The Program Analyzer script processes the programs generated by the Grammar Enumerator and performs analyses on them.

#### **Script Location**

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/programsAnalysis.py`

#### **Dependencies**

This script requires the file:

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/results/programs.txt`

#### **Execution**

Run the script using Python:

bash

Copy code

```bash
python3 programsAnalysis.py
```

#### **Performance Note**

Execution time can be significant if the number of programs in `programs.txt` is large.

#### **Output**

The analysis results are saved in the following file:

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/results/programsAnalysis.txt`

---

### 3. **Density Plot**

The Density Plot script generates a density plot based on the analysis performed by the Program Analyzer.

#### **Script Location**

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/programsDensityPlot.py`

#### **Dependencies**

This script requires the file:

`src/scripts/grammarEnumeration/results/programsAnalysis.txt`

#### **Execution**

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python3 programsDensityPlot.py`
```
#### **Output**

The plot will be generated and saved as a file or displayed based on the script's configuration.

---

## Notes

1. Ensure all dependencies and environment requirements (e.g., Python version, libraries) are met before running the scripts.
2. Be cautious with high depth values in the Grammar Enumerator, as they may lead to exponential growth in generated programs and increased processing times.

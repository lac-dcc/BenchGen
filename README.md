# BenchGen


The goal of this project is to synthesize programs that are sufficiently expressive to stress-test computing systems, such as operating systems, compiler optimizations, memory allocation libraries and even computer architectures.

Code components of BenchGen can be found in the `src` folder, each documented in their own directories.
